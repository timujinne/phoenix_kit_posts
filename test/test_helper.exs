# Test helper for PhoenixKitPosts.
#
# Two levels:
#
#   * unit — schemas, changesets, slug generation. Always run, no database.
#   * integration — tagged `:integration` via `PhoenixKitPosts.DataCase`,
#     excluded automatically when PostgreSQL is unavailable.
#
# First-time setup:
#
#   createdb phoenix_kit_posts_test
#
# The posts tables still live in CORE's versioned chain (core creates every
# one of them on every install), but their FUTURE shape belongs to this
# module's own chain, `PhoenixKitPosts.Migrations`. The schema is built by
# `PhoenixKit.Migration.ensure_current/2` first — the same call a host app
# makes — then this module's own V1 on top, stamping every test run's
# database `pkpo_schema:1`.

# `test/support` is on elixirc_paths for :test (mix.exs), so the repo and case
# are already compiled here — requiring the files as well would redefine both
# modules and warn on every run.

    # for a reason unrelated to what it is asking.

    # `start_link/0` connects lazily, so it succeeds against a database that
    # does not exist — the first real query is what fails, and by then every
    # test is running and timing out one settings read at a time. Ask a
    # question first.
